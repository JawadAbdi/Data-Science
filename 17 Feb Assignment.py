# MongoDB is a popular non-relational database management system (DBMS) that falls under the category of NoSQL databases. It is designed to store and manage unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data in a flexible and scalable manner.
# 
# Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are alternatives to traditional relational databases (SQL databases). Unlike SQL databases that organize data into tables with predefined schemas and relationships, non-relational databases offer a more flexible data model. They can store and handle large volumes of diverse and evolving data types, such as documents, key-value pairs, graphs, and more. NoSQL databases are often preferred when there is a need for:
# 
# Flexibility and scalability: Non-relational databases like MongoDB are highly flexible and can adapt to changing data structures without requiring schema modifications. This makes them suitable for scenarios where the data schema is subject to frequent changes or when dealing with semi-structured or unstructured data.
# 
# High-speed read and write operations: NoSQL databases are optimized for high-performance read and write operations, making them well-suited for handling large volumes of data and high-traffic applications. MongoDB, for example, can provide low-latency access to data due to its ability to horizontally scale across multiple servers.
# 
# Distributed and cloud environments: Non-relational databases are designed to work seamlessly in distributed and cloud-based environments. They can be easily distributed across multiple servers and handle large-scale deployments, making them a good fit for cloud-native and scalable applications.
# 
# Real-time analytics and event-driven applications: NoSQL databases excel in handling real-time data processing and analytics. They can efficiently handle data streams, event-driven architectures, and complex queries, making them preferred choices for applications dealing with IoT, social media, real-time analytics, and more.
# 
# It's important to note that the choice between MongoDB (NoSQL) and SQL databases depends on the specific requirements of your application. Relational databases (SQL) still have their own strengths in scenarios where data relationships, strict consistency, and complex transactions are crucial. Ultimately, the decision should be based on careful consideration of the data structure, scalability needs, query patterns, and performance requirements of your project.

# MongoDB offers several features that make it a popular choice among developers and organizations. Here are some key features of MongoDB:
# 
# Document-oriented: MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means it stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON). Documents can have varying structures, allowing for dynamic schema changes and easy representation of complex data types.
# 
# Scalability and High Performance: MongoDB is designed for horizontal scalability, allowing you to distribute data across multiple servers or clusters. It can handle large volumes of data and high read/write workloads, providing high performance and low-latency access to data.
# 
# Flexible Data Model: MongoDB's flexible data model allows you to store and manage data of different types and structures within the same collection. This flexibility makes it easy to accommodate evolving data requirements without the need for costly schema migrations.
# 
# Rich Query Language: MongoDB provides a powerful query language that supports a wide range of query operations, including filtering, sorting, aggregation, and geospatial queries. It also supports full-text search and advanced indexing options to optimize query performance.
# 
# Replication and High Availability: MongoDB offers built-in replication, allowing you to create replica sets that automatically maintain multiple copies of data across different servers. This provides fault tolerance and high availability, ensuring that data remains accessible even in the event of hardware failures.
# 
# Flexible Transactions: MongoDB supports multi-document ACID transactions, enabling you to perform multiple operations as a single atomic unit of work. This ensures data consistency and integrity when dealing with complex transactions across multiple documents or collections.
# 
# Horizontal Partitioning: MongoDB allows you to partition data across multiple shards, enabling horizontal scaling and efficient distribution of data. This feature helps to handle growing data volumes and high throughput requirements.
# 
# Rich Ecosystem and Community Support: MongoDB has a vibrant and active community with extensive documentation, tutorials, and resources. It also offers a comprehensive set of tools, drivers, and connectors, making it easier to integrate MongoDB into various programming languages and frameworks.
# 
# Ad hoc Queries and Aggregation Framework: MongoDB's ad hoc query capability allows you to query and analyze data on the fly without requiring predefined joins or relationships. It also provides a powerful Aggregation Framework that supports complex data aggregation, transformation, and analysis operations.
# 
# These features make MongoDB a popular choice for developers working on modern applications that require scalability, flexibility, and high performance in handling diverse and evolving data.

# To connect MongoDB to Python, you can make use of the pymongo library, which is the official Python driver for MongoDB. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to connect to MongoDB, create a database, and a collection:
# 
# First, we import the pymongo library.
# We create a MongoClient object and specify the connection URL. Here, we're connecting to a MongoDB instance running on localhost at the default port 27017. You can modify the connection URL as per your MongoDB setup.
# Next, we specify the name of the database we want to create by assigning it to the database_name variable. We then use the client object to access the database by assigning it to the database variable.
# Similarly, we specify the name of the collection we want to create by assigning it to the collection_name variable. We use the database object to access the collection by assigning it to the collection variable.
# Finally, we can perform various operations on the collection. In this example, we insert a document into the collection using the insert_one() method.
# After performing the desired operations, it is important to close the MongoDB connection using the close() method of the client object.
# Remember to install the pymongo library before running the code. You can install it using pip by running the command pip install pymongo.

# In[4]:


get_ipython().system('pip install pymongo')


# In[5]:


import pymongo

# Connect to MongoDB
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017")

# Create a database
database_name = "mydatabase"
database = client[database_name]

# Create a collection
collection_name = "mycollection"
collection = database[collection_name]

# Perform database and collection operations
# For example, insert a document into the collection
document = {"name": "John Doe", "age": 30}
collection.insert_one(document)

# Close the MongoDB connection
client.close()


# In[6]:


from pymongo import MongoClient

# Connect to MongoDB
client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017")

# Access the database and collection
db = client["mydatabase"]
collection = db["mycollection"]

# Insert one record
record_one = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
collection.insert_one(record_one)
print("Inserted one record:", record_one)

# Insert many records
records_many = [
    {
        "name": "Jane Smith",
        "age": 25,
        "email": "jane.smith@example.com"
    },
    {
        "name": "Bob Johnson",
        "age": 35,
        "email": "bob.johnson@example.com"
    },
    {
        "name": "Alice Williams",
        "age": 28,
        "email": "alice.williams@example.com"
    }
]
collection.insert_many(records_many)
print("Inserted many records:", records_many)

# Find and print the inserted records
print("Find one record:")
print(collection.find_one({"name": "John Doe"}))

print("Find all records:")
for record in collection.find():
    print(record)


# In MongoDB, the find() method is used to query a collection and retrieve documents that match certain criteria. It allows you to specify a query filter to narrow down the results based on specific conditions. Here's a simple code example demonstrating the usage of the find() method in MongoDB:

# In[7]:


# Import the necessary libraries
from pymongo import MongoClient

# Connect to the MongoDB database
client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client['mydatabase']  # Replace 'mydatabase' with your actual database name
collection = db['mycollection']  # Replace 'mycollection' with your actual collection name

# Define a query filter
query = {"name": "John"}

# Use the find() method to retrieve documents matching the query filter
results = collection.find(query)

# Iterate over the results and print each document
for doc in results:
    print(doc)

# Close the database connection
client.close()


# In the above code, we first import the MongoClient class from the pymongo library. Then, we establish a connection to the MongoDB server by specifying the connection URL (mongodb://localhost:27017/). You should replace it with the appropriate connection URL for your MongoDB deployment.
# 
# Next, we access the desired database and collection using the client['mydatabase'] and db['mycollection'] syntax, respectively. Replace 'mydatabase' and 'mycollection' with the actual names of your database and collection.
# 
# We define a query filter in the query variable, which in this case looks for documents with a "name" field equal to "John". You can modify the filter to match your specific requirements.
# 
# We then pass the query filter to the find() method of the collection, which returns a cursor pointing to the result set. We can iterate over the cursor to access each matching document.
# 
# Finally, we print each document, and after we're done, we close the database connection using client.close().
# 
# Remember to ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed (such as pymongo) before running the code.

# In MongoDB, the sort() method is used to sort the documents returned by a query in a specified order. It allows you to sort the results based on one or more fields in ascending or descending order. The sort() method can be used in conjunction with the find() method to retrieve sorted documents from a collection. Here's an example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB
# 
# The find().sort() combination returns a cursor pointing to the sorted result set. We can iterate over the cursor to access each sorted document.
# 
# Finally, we print each sorted document and close the database connection using client.close().
# 
# You can modify the sorting field and order as per your requirements to achieve the desired sorting behavior.

# In MongoDB, the delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() methods are used to remove documents or collections from a MongoDB database. Each of these methods serves a specific purpose:
# 
# delete_one() method: This method is used to delete a single document that matches a specified filter. It removes the first document that matches the filter criteria and then stops. If multiple documents match the filter, only the first one encountered is deleted. The delete_one() method is useful when you want to remove a specific document from a collection.
# 
# delete_many() method: This method is used to delete multiple documents that match a specified filter. It removes all documents that meet the filter criteria. The delete_many() method is useful when you want to remove multiple documents from a collection based on certain conditions.
# 
# drop() method: This method is used to remove an entire collection from a MongoDB database. It deletes the collection along with all the documents it contains. The drop() method is useful when you want to completely remove a collection and all its associated data.
# 
# It's important to note that these methods permanently remove data from the database, so caution should be exercised when using them. It's recommended to make backups or take other precautions before performing deletions or dropping collections to avoid accidental data loss.
