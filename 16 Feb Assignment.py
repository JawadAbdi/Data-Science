# A database is a structured collection of data that is organized, stored, and managed in a way that enables efficient data retrieval and manipulation. It provides a systematic approach for storing and managing large volumes of structured or unstructured data.
# 
# Here are the key differences between SQL (relational) and NoSQL (non-relational) databases:
# 
# SQL Databases:
# 
# Structure: SQL databases are based on the relational model, where data is organized into tables with predefined schemas. Tables consist of rows (records) and columns (fields). The relationships between tables are defined by keys (primary and foreign keys).
# Schema: SQL databases enforce a predefined schema, which specifies the structure, data types, and relationships of the data. Changes to the schema require altering the table structure.
# Query Language: SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to query and manipulate data in SQL databases. It provides a standardized way to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data.
# ACID Compliance: SQL databases typically provide ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring transactional integrity and data consistency.
# Scalability: SQL databases are vertically scalable, meaning they can handle increased workload by adding more resources (CPU, memory) to a single server. Horizontal scalability can be achieved through database replication or sharding techniques.
# NoSQL Databases:
# 
# Structure: NoSQL databases have a flexible and schema-less data model. They can handle unstructured or semi-structured data without predefined schemas. Data is typically stored in collections, documents, key-value pairs, wide-column stores, or graph structures.
# Schema: NoSQL databases do not enforce a rigid schema, allowing for dynamic and evolving data structures. Each document or record can have its own structure.
# Query Language: NoSQL databases use different query languages or APIs depending on their specific type. For example, MongoDB uses a document-oriented query language, Cassandra uses CQL (Cassandra Query Language), and Redis uses simple key-value operations.
# CAP Theorem: NoSQL databases often follow the principles of the CAP (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance) theorem. Depending on their design, they prioritize availability and partition tolerance over strict consistency.
# Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability, making it easier to distribute data across multiple servers and handle large-scale data storage and processing. They are well-suited for handling big data and high-traffic applications.
# In summary, SQL databases provide a structured and relational approach to data storage with a predefined schema and standardized query language. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, offer flexibility, scalability, and schema-less data storage for unstructured or semi-structured data, using different data models and query languages. The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on factors such as the nature of the data, scalability requirements, consistency needs, and specific use cases of the application.

# DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define and manage the structure of a database. DDL statements are responsible for creating, modifying, and deleting database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and constraints.
# 
# Let's explain the following DDL statements:
# 
# CREATE: The CREATE statement is used to create a new database object, such as a table, view, index, or constraint.
# 
# DROP: The DROP statement is used to remove or delete a database object, such as a table or view.
# 
# ALTER: The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. It allows you to add, modify, or delete columns, constraints, or other properties of the object.
# 
# TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all data from a table while keeping its structure intact. It is faster and more efficient than the DELETE statement when you want to delete all rows from a table.

# DML stands for Data Manipulation Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to manipulate data within a database. DML statements are responsible for inserting, updating, and deleting data in database tables.
# 
# Let's explain the following DML statements:
# 
# INSERT: The INSERT statement is used to insert new rows of data into a table.
# 
# UPDATE: The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing data in a table. It allows you to change the values of one or more columns in one or more rows based on specified conditions.
# 
# DELETE: The DELETE statement is used to remove one or more rows from a table. It allows you to selectively delete rows based on specified conditions. 

# DQL stands for Data Query Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to retrieve and query data from a database. DQL statements, particularly the SELECT statement, are primarily focused on fetching and retrieving data.
# 
# Let's explain the SELECT statement with an example:
# 
# The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. It allows you to specify the columns to retrieve, the table(s) from which to retrieve the data, and any conditions or filters to apply.

# Primary Key:
# A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each record in the table. It serves as a unique identifier for the records and ensures data integrity and consistency. Here are some key points about primary keys:
# 
# Uniqueness: A primary key must contain unique values for each record in the table. No two records can have the same primary key value.
# Non-nullability: A primary key column cannot contain null (empty) values. Every record must have a valid value for the primary key.
# Single or Composite: A primary key can be a single column or a combination of multiple columns that collectively form a unique identifier for the records.
# Indexing: Primary keys are usually indexed in the database, which allows for efficient retrieval and searching of data based on the primary key values.
# Enforcement of Data Integrity: Primary keys ensure the integrity of the data by preventing duplicate records and providing a reliable means of referencing and identifying individual records.
# Foreign Key:
# A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that establishes a link or relationship between two tables. It defines a dependency between the data in two tables based on the values in the foreign key column(s). Here are some key points about foreign keys:
# 
# Relationship Establishment: A foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables by referencing the primary key column(s) of another table.
# Referential Integrity: A foreign key ensures referential integrity, meaning that the values in the foreign key column(s) must match the values of the primary key column(s) in the referenced table. It ensures that data relationships between tables are valid and consistent.
# Parent-Child Relationship: The table containing the foreign key is known as the child table, and the table being referenced by the foreign key is known as the parent table. The foreign key column(s) in the child table contains values that exist in the primary key column(s) of the parent table.
# Cascading Actions: Foreign keys can define cascading actions, such as ON DELETE and ON UPDATE, to specify what happens when a record in the parent table is deleted or updated. For example, cascading delete can automatically delete related records in the child table when the corresponding parent record is deleted.
# Data Integrity and Consistency: Foreign keys ensure the integrity and consistency of the data by enforcing relationships and preventing orphaned or inconsistent data.
# Primary keys and foreign keys are essential components of relational databases. They establish relationships between tables, maintain data integrity, and enable efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

# cursor(): The cursor() method creates a cursor object that allows you to execute SQL statements and interact with the MySQL database. It is called on the database connection object (conn in the example).
# 
# execute(): The execute() method is used to execute SQL queries or statements. It takes an SQL query as a parameter and executes it using the cursor object. In the example, we pass the SQL query to retrieve all rows from a table: "SELECT * FROM your_table". The execute() method returns the result of the query execution.
# 
# It's worth noting that you can also pass parameters to the execute() method using parameter placeholders (%s) and provide the values as a tuple. This allows you to execute parameterized queries and prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
# 
# After executing the query with execute(), you can fetch the results using methods like fetchone() (to retrieve a single row), fetchall() (to retrieve all rows), or fetchmany(n) (to retrieve a specific number of rows). In the example, we use fetchall() to retrieve all rows and then iterate over the result set to print each row.
# 
# Finally, it's important to close the cursor and connection using the close() method. Closing the cursor and connection releases the resources associated with the database connection and ensures proper cleanup.
# 
# By using the cursor() and execute() methods, you can establish a connection to MySQL, execute queries, retrieve results, and interact with the database in your Python code.

# In an SQL query, the clauses are typically executed in the following order:
# 
# FROM: Specifies the table or tables from which the data will be retrieved.
# WHERE: Filters the data based on specified conditions.
# GROUP BY: Groups the rows based on specified columns.
# HAVING: Filters the grouped data based on specified conditions.
# SELECT: Specifies the columns to be included in the result set.
# DISTINCT: Filters out duplicate rows from the result set.
# ORDER BY: Sorts the result set based on specified columns and sorting criteria.
# LIMIT/OFFSET: Limits the number of rows returned or skips a specified number of rows.
# INSERT: Inserts new rows into a table.
# UPDATE: Modifies existing rows in a table.
# DELETE: Deletes rows from a table.
# UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT: Combines or compares result sets of multiple queries.
# COMMIT/ROLLBACK: Commits or rolls back a transaction (if applicable).
# CREATE: Creates a new table, view, or other database objects.
# ALTER: Modifies the structure of an existing table or other database objects.
# DROP: Deletes a table, view, or other database objects.
# TRUNCATE: Removes all data from a table.
# It's important to note that not all clauses are required in every SQL query, and the order may vary depending on the specific query and its requirements. However, this sequence represents a typical order of execution and is commonly followed when constructing SQL queries.
